The most important avenues of learning are ensuring that I remain relevant and up to date in my area of specialty, network articles, and developing skills in relation to the aspects of my career path.\n\n\n2.2 Professional Networks\nCPD is mainly centered on professional networking. I renew LinkedIn to have a professional profile, to access educational materials, as well as communicating with peers and people in the industry. Another way through which I have communicated with fellow professionals to widen my understanding of industry expectations is acquiring other pertinent professional societies and online communities such as webinars and conferences.\nProgramme and Employability The workforce needed to become familiar with the modifications in programmes and how the workforce is to be employed.\nAn option to programme milestones and learning outcomes has assisted me to determine pertinent graduate attributes and development spheres. Some of the activities such as work experience, internships, and skills-oriented programs have supported my knowledge in the expectations of the employers and career opportunities.\n\n\n2.3 Challenges\nKey challenges include balancing academic commitments with CPD activities, building confidence in networking, and managing time effectively."

    "text": "2 Reflection\n\n2.1 What I Have Learned\nThroughout my programme, I have developed a structured approach to locating, evaluating, and synthesising information from a range of academic and professional sources. Key areas of learning include:\n\nLibrary databases and search strategies: I have learned to use subject-specific databases effectively, selecting appropriate keywords and controlled vocabulary to improve search precision and recall (Muir and Thomson 2023).\nBoolean operators and query formulation: Applying Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) and advanced search filters has enabled me to refine searches and manage large result sets more efficiently.\nSource evaluation and credibility assessment: I have developed greater awareness of criteria such as authorship, publication venue, methodology, and citation patterns when assessing the reliability and relevance of sources (Bloom and Weisberg 2020).\nLiterature review processes: I have learned to synthesise findings across multiple studies, identify themes and gaps in the literature, and position sources within an academic argument (Creswell 2018).\n\nThese skills have been applied in coursework and research tasks, improving the quality, coherence, and academic rigour of my written work.\n\n\n2.2 Research Question Framework\nTo support structured inquiry, I have used established research question frameworks such as PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome), particularly when engaging with applied or evidence-based research (Sackett et al. 1996).\n\nStrengths: The framework encourages clarity, focus, and alignment between the research question and search strategy, which supports systematic literature searching.\nWeaknesses: PICO can be restrictive when applied to exploratory or qualitative research, where research questions may need to remain flexible and emergent.\nPractical application: Using PICO has helped me translate broad topics into manageable research questions, improving the relevance and efficiency of database searches.\n\nEngaging with such frameworks has reinforced the importance of methodological alignment between research questions, search strategies, and evaluation criteria (Creswell 2018).\n\n\n2.3 Challenges and Insights\nThe greatest problem has been handling information overload especially when search results yield a great amount of information that is of different quality. Developing effective filtering strategies and applying critical evaluation criteria has been essential in addressing this issue (Muir and Thomson 2023).\nOther complications consist of paywalled access to resources, time management when conducting the literature review. Reflective engagement with these challenges has highlighted the importance of self-regulated learning strategies, such as planning, monitoring progress, and adapting approaches when necessary (Zimmerman 2002).\nAnother important learning has been the realization that information literacy is not a one-time skill set that requires no further development, but a practice that must constantly be practiced through the continual development of tools, databases, and academic criteria."

    "text": "2 Reflection\n\n2.1 What I Have Learned\nThrough sustained academic use and coursework, I have developed foundational to intermediate proficiency across the Microsoft Office suite, aligning with recognised digital literacy frameworks that emphasise communication, information management, and collaboration skills (JISC 2023).\n\nMicrosoft Word: I have also understood how to format academic reports in terms of styles, headings, tables of contents, and references managers. These practices support academic writing conventions and improve clarity and consistency in formal texts, particularly in collaborative contexts (Norton, Brunas-Wagstaff, and Lockwood 2008).\nMicrosoft Excel: I have trained to enter structured data, use simple and intermediate formulas (e.g. IF statements, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP) and also learned how to use pivot tables to summarise and analyse data. These skills support evidence-based reasoning and decision-making by enabling more systematic engagement with data (Sackett et al. 1996).\nMicrosoft PowerPoint: I have acquired skills on how to approach the design of a slide successfully, such as visual hierarchy, text concise, and in accordance with the expectation of the audience. These skills are essential for communicating complex ideas clearly in academic and professional settings (Cheshire 2013).\n\nThe competencies have been used in some coursework submission, group projects, and presentation, which have made a difference in my better clarity, consistency, and professionalism.\n\n\n2.2 AI Integration\nThe growing adoption of AI functionality has impacted my enterprise tools usage to a great extent. Word has Microsoft Copilot which assists with drafting, summarisation, and revision, whereas Microsoft Excel contains AI-assisted applications that help to find patterns within datasets and propose methods of analysis. PowerPoint designer assists in the visual design and consistency.\nFrom an educational perspective, such tools reflect broader developments in generative AI within learning environments, offering opportunities for efficiency while raising important pedagogical and ethical considerations (UNESCO 2023; Floridi and Cowley 2019). Although AI has enhanced productivity and saved on time used on mundane chores the technology has also posed the danger of over-dependence. Research on learning and cognition suggests that excessive automation may limit deeper engagement and conceptual understanding if not used reflectively (Bloom and Weisberg 2020).\nTherefore, I have grown increasingly conscious of my application of AI as a secondary tool instead of a substitute of critical thinking, authorship, and design judgment.\n\n\n2.3 Challenges and Insights\nSome of the major ones as indicated above involve dealing with complicated format in long word files, learning of sophisticated excel features and handling team work where differences in practices may interfere with document quality. These challenges reflect broader issues identified in collaborative academic and digital work, where technical proficiency must be matched with shared standards and communication (Cheshire 2013).\nBalancing automation with manual control has required reflective self-assessment, reinforcing the importance of metacognitive awareness in skill development (Baume and Popovic 2007; Zimmerman 2002). An important insight has been recognising that professional competence is not defined solely by familiarity with tools, but by the ability to apply them critically, ethically, and in contextually appropriate ways (Creswell 2018)."

Developing these skills supports higher-order cognitive processes, such as analysis and evaluation, as outlined in revised learning taxonomies (Krathwohl 2002)."

    "text": "2 Reflection\n\n2.1 What I Have Learned\nThrough coursework and practical experimentation, I have developed an understanding of both the practical and conceptual aspects of version control and collaborative development:\n\nGit repositories and version control: I have learned how Git records changes over time, enabling safe experimentation, rollback, and transparent tracking of contributions (Spinellis 2005).\nGit workflows and collaboration: I have used branching and merging to support parallel development, enabling multiple contributors to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes.\nGitHub Pages publishing: I have learned to publish static websites directly from repositories, supporting portfolio development and public dissemination of work.\nCommand-line Git usage: Using Git via the command line has improved my understanding of core version control concepts and increased confidence in navigating development environments.\nApplied projects: These skills have been applied in individual and group projects, reinforcing the connection between technical knowledge and real-world collaborative practice.\n\n\n\n2.2 Technical Understanding\nDeveloping technical literacy in Git has required understanding its underlying data model and operational logic:\n\nGit data structures: Git stores data as objects, including blobs (file contents), trees (directory structures), and commits (snapshots of the project history). References, branches, and HEAD enable navigation and manipulation of project states (Spinellis 2005).\nEssential commands: Core commands such as init, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, and clone support the full lifecycle of local and remote version control (GitHub, Inc. 2024).\nWorkflow model: Understanding the movement of changes from the working directory to the staging area, local repository, and remote repository has clarified how Git enforces deliberate and traceable change management.\n\nThis conceptual understanding has improved my ability to diagnose errors and resolve conflicts when they arise.\n\n\n2.3 Collaboration and Challenges\nGit and GitHub also have particularly important features related to collaborative work, such as a detailed record of changes, the possibility to roll back to an earlier version, and parallel development. These features are particularly valuable in collaborative and interdisciplinary projects, where transparency and accountability are essential (Cheshire 2013).\nNevertheless, there have been difficulties such as struggling with conflict management in merging, anxiety stemming when working on a command line and team coordination. The solution to these challenges has involved effective communication, similar conventions, and meditated problem-solving. This, over time, has made me confident about the value of working in a technical environment in which I collaborate with others, and the importance of a structured version control system."

Use of these tools has demonstrated to be useful in both for efficiency and in explaining as well as the threats that come with its misuse or over use.\nSchool Environment Research Responsible Provenience use in educational institutions.\nBrainstorming, drafting assistance, concept explanation, code generating and data analyzing activities are some of the responsible academic uses of AI. Nevertheless, it is unacceptable to hand the work created by AI as my own without the process of learning or using the results without checking.\nResponsible use has an aspect of transparency. That involves recognizing AI assistance when needed and adhering to institutional disclosure and referring directions.\n\n\n2.2 Academic Integrity\nAI contributes to the appearance of new types of threats to plagiarism, especially the generation of the text with passing off as original work. Distinguishing between AI as a support tool and AI as a content generator is essential, as academic responsibility remains with the student (Charmaz 2014). I have also got to know that any AI-based results should be assessed critically, examined, and brought into my scope of work in an ethical way.\nProfessional and Future Usage of AI.\nLooking ahead, responsible AI use will be shaped by organisational policies, professional standards, and evolving regulation (JISC 2023). To be more precise, in the future, the need to develop AI literacy will become inevitable as it will allow using AI in a workplace consciously, ethically, and transparently."
