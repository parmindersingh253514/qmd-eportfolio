## Overview

This section is the reflection of my need to do continuous professional development (CPD) as the student and a future professional. It considers how ongoing learning, professional networking, and engagement with programme requirements support the development of employable graduate attributes [@Baume2007].

## Reflection

### What I Have Learned

I have developed an understanding of CPD as a lifelong process that requires active planning and self-regulation [@Zimmerman2002]. The most important avenues of learning are ensuring that I remain relevant and up to date in my area of specialty, network articles, and developing skills in relation to the aspects of my career path.

### Professional Networks

CPD is mainly centered on professional networking. I renew LinkedIn to have a professional profile, to access educational materials, as well as communicating with peers and people in the industry. Another way through which I have communicated with fellow professionals to widen my understanding of industry expectations is acquiring other pertinent professional societies and online communities such as webinars and conferences.

Programme and Employability The workforce needed to become familiar with the modifications in programmes and how the workforce is to be employed.

An option to programme milestones and learning outcomes has assisted me to determine pertinent graduate attributes and development spheres. Some of the activities such as work experience, internships, and skills-oriented programs have supported my knowledge in the expectations of the employers and career opportunities.

### Challenges

Key challenges include balancing academic commitments with CPD activities, building confidence in networking, and managing time effectively.

## Self-Assessment

### Current CPD Capability

**Self-assessed level (novice → intermediate → advanced → expert):**

- Professional networking  
- Understanding degree requirements  
- Awareness of graduate attributes  
- Career planning  

Current CPD activities include maintaining a LinkedIn profile, attending development events, and engaging with skills-building resources.

## Forward Plan

### Development Plan (Next 12 Months)

- **0–3 months**: Update LinkedIn profile, join relevant professional societies, attend introductory events.  
- **3–6 months**: Build professional relationships, complete targeted development courses, clarify career goals.  
- **6–12 months**: Maintain regular networking activity, pursue internship opportunities, and develop a professional portfolio.

These actions support structured CPD and ongoing employability development.
